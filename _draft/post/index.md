  funding_section_card_description_1: Currently there is no full time team who is working to develop new features and improve the service. To consistently move the product forward, a core team is needed.
  funding_section_card_description_2: We pay for fast servers, so anyone in the world can download free map data updates without delays. The maps data transfers are hundreds of terabytes monthly, and the amount is growing.
