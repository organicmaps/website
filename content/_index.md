**Organic Maps** is a privacy-focused offline maps & GPS app for hiking, cycling, biking, and driving. Absolutely free. No ads. No tracking. Developed with love by the open-source community and the same people, who created [**MapsWithMe**][mapswithme]/**Maps.Me** app. Powered by [OpenStreetMap][openstreetmap] data.
