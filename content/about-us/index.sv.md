        title: Free and open navigation with privacy, built by the community
        text: Organic Maps is a community-focused privacy navigation app for travelers - drivers, hikers, and cyclists. It uses the crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data with contributors from all over the globe. It offers navigation with privacy - no identifying people and no data collection. Organic Maps features can operate without an active internet connection for offline navigation at urban or distant locations, where cellular service is not available. Organic Maps is an open-source project, and prioritizes community development.
