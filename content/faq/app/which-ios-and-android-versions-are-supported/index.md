You need at least iOS 12 or Android 5 to run the app. Devices with later versions can run Organic Maps.

In Android, Organic Maps can work on devices with Google Services installed and without Google support.

Android devices must support OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher, or Vulkan API to work.

To use OM with Android Auto, please check the requirements [here](../how-to-use-android-auto/).
