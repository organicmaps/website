Tap a bookmark or track on the map or in the list, and then tap the "Share" button on the place page (bottom panel).

To share all bookmarks and tracks in a list from the Bookmarks and Tracks screen, tap the icon with three dots to the right of the name of the list and select "Export KMZ", "Export GPX", or "Export GeoJSON".
