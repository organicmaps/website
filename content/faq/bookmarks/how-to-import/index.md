You can import bookmarks and/or tracks sent from Organic Maps or third party apps if they export bookmarks in KML, KMZ, KMB, GPX or GeoJSON (JSON) formats.

To import a single file:

1. Locate downloaded or shared KML, KMZ, KMB, GPX, GeoJSON (JSON) file sent by email, instant messenger or cloud storage, for example, iCloud or Google Drive.
2. Tap once or tap and hold the KML, KMZ, KMB, GPX, GeoJSON (JSON) file and choose "Open with Organic Maps" (Android) or "Import with Organic Maps" (an icon with a square box and an arrow on iOS) in the pop-up window.
3. Organic Maps should be launched, and you should see "Bookmarks loaded successfully!" message. You can see imported Bookmarks and/or Tracks on the map and on the "Bookmarks and Tracks" screen.

Importing bookmarks and tracks in batch is also possible:

1. Open Organic Maps and tap "stars with dots" button to open bookmarks and tracks. Press "Import Bookmarks and Tracks" button.
2. Select a folder with KML, KMZ, KMB, GPX, GeoJSON (JSON) files. On Android, Organic Maps will scan it including subfolders and import all supported files with bookmarks and tracks. You can choose root folder to search over all storage.
