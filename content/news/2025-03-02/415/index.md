March Organic Maps Update: iOS Search Split-Screen Mode, Individual Track Sharing and Enhanced Bicycle Routing.

Our latest update introduces several enhancements to improve your navigation experience:
* ✅ iOS Search Split-Screen Mode:​ View the map and search results list simultaneously, making it easier and faster to find places.​
* ✅ Individual Track Sharing:​ Share a specific single track your big bookmarks & tracks list.​

* ✅ Android Route Customization:​ Manually arrange intermediate route points, providing greater flexibility and control in trip planning.​
* ✅ Android Track Recording Indicator: Added an indicator on the main screen to remind that Track Recording is active; tap it to bring up the recording menu!
