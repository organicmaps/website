Organic Maps is a community-driven, open-source alternative to Big Tech navigation apps, built with love by people like you. From day one, it has upheld high standards and stood firmly on uncompromising values and principles:

- **Open-Source**. Organic Maps is proudly open-source under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. Contributors retain full copyright and are never required to give up their rights to any corporation. The code belongs to authors. No one can close it, and no one can take it away from you.
- **Privacy-Focused**. Privacy isn’t a feature — it’s a fundamental human right. Organic Maps never collects your personal or location data. Everything stays on your device, so you can explore the world freely and safely, wherever you are.
- **Community-Driven**. Organic Maps isn’t built by corporations — it’s built by people like you, who care. Everyone is welcome to contribute, no matter who you are, where you’re from, or what you believe. This is your app, too.

## Recent Improvements

Over the course of its lifetime, Organic Maps has faced challenges that revealed moments when we didn’t fully live up to our own values. Recognizing these has been an important step toward becoming a more mature and resilient project. Over the past six months, we’ve taken concrete steps to become more open, transparent, and community-driven. Here’s what we have been done in the six months:

- **No closed doors.**
  Project discussions transitioned from numerous private Telegram chats to a public Zulip workspace, moving conversations out from behind closed doors to foster openness and streamline communication.
- **Driven by expertise.**
  Expert groups in key areas such as Android, iOS, C++, Design, Marketing, User Support, Infrastructure, and others were formed to support decentralized, community-led decision-making by contributors with relevant expertise.
- **Transparent contributions.**
  A more formalized code review process was introduced and enforced via CODEOWNERS to ensure that merges follow clear and transparent criteria, reducing ambiguity and clarifying who is responsible for reviews.
- **Decentralized authority.**
  Merge access was granted to trusted contributors for pull requests that meet the review criteria, helping increase development velocity and distribute responsibility.
- **Collaborative process.**
  The feature development process now follows a more structured and transparent workflow that includes gathering input, drafting ideas openly, and encouraging broad collaboration.
- **Distributed user support.**
  The user support process was redesigned to be decentralized, allowing broader participation in helping users and managing feedback transparently.
- **Everything out in the open.**
  Certain parts of the codebase that were previously mistakenly available only to a limited number of contributors (such as the metaserver and experimental generator patches) have now been made public to improve collaboration and project transparency.
- **Mitigating risks from Big Tech service providers.**
  Dependencies on Big Tech platforms like GitHub and Cloudflare were reviewed, and alternatives were explored to ensure the project won’t be disrupted by changes from third-party providers.

## Legal Structure

Recently, there has been some confusion and speculation surrounding **Organic Maps OÜ**, the legal entity that has supported the project for the past four years. Organic Maps OÜ is fully operational and in good standing, with all previous shareholder issues now resolved.

Organic Maps OÜ provides essential **legal protection** to the team — ensuring that the trademark, accounts, and collected funds remain secure and safeguarded in the best interests of the project, in full compliance with the high standards of the European Union.

Organic Maps OÜ has **no investors, venture capitalists, or corporate owners**. The entity is managed by the founders, who are committed to keeping the project independent, open, and community-driven.

Organic Maps OÜ continues to collect donations and maintain the project infrastructure. All funds raised have been consistently reinvested into the project — with a strong focus on engineering, infrastructure, and user support, and with almost non-existing spending on marketing or promotion. No dividends have ever been distributed, and **no profit** has been generated.

Organic Maps OÜ is required to publish its **annual financial report** no later than June 30, 2025, disclosing income and expenses in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The formal accounting review process has been improved to ensure full financial oversight and compliance.

## Looking Forward

Organic Maps is growing not just in code, but in responsibility. It learns, adapts, and earns trust with every challenge — with its community at the center. As an open-source project, Organic Maps is shaped by those who show up. We believe that good ideas and good intentions should guide not just the code, but the direction — and we’re keeping that in mind as the project continues to evolve.

We’re deeply grateful for your support — and excited to keep building the future of Organic Maps together with you.

Regards, Roman
