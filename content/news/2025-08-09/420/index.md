Install the August release of Organic Maps, download the latest maps, and discover popular hiking and cycling routes all over the world! Press the top-left "Layers" button to view colored bicycle and MTB routes, as well as official hiking and walking paths. Don't see anything nearby? Then it's time to add the missing information to OpenStreetMap.org, since all map data in Organic Maps comes from that open, free, and community-driven project.

Did you know that any recorded or imported GPX/KML track on the map can be selected? Tracks with altitude data will display their elevation graph.

To see bookmark names on the map, enable this new feature in the Organic Maps settings.

Thanks to our contributors ❤️ and your [donations](@/donate/index.md), there's much more in this update.

P.S. …and much more is coming! Your support helps and motivates us to build the best maps – together.
