Now, when you select a bus or tram stop, you can see the public transport route numbers. This is just the first step! Next, we plan to show public transport routes directly on the map. iOS users can also enjoy redesigned OpenStreetMap contribution buttons ("Add Place" and "Edit Place").

We are grateful ❤️ to our contributors, as well as for [your donations](@/donate/index.md) and [your support](@/contribute/index.md).
