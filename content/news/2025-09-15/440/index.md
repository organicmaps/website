This second September release brings a redesigned route planning screen and the ability to view OpenStreetMap `description` tag contents for iOS users. To discover places that have this tag, type `?description` in the search box (similar to typing `?wiki` for Wikipedia-linked places).

There are also many fixes and improvements on both iOS and Android (details below).

And, of course, a reminder about other recent features you might have missed:
- Public transport route numbers when selecting a bus stop
- Hiking and cycling routes (toggle them via the Layers button in the top left)
- Enable bookmark names on the map in the app Settings
- The âœŽ pencil icon offers a quick way to edit bookmarks

Organic Maps is possible thanks to our contributors, [your donations](@/donate/index.md), and [your support](@/contribute/index.md).
