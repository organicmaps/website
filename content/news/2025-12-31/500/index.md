As 2025 comes to an end, we’d like to look back on the year, reflect on our achievements, and share a few insights with you.

Despite many challenges, we got back on track and shipped [13 app releases](/news/releases/) this year with many improvements.
Several notable features were introduced, including [global hiking and cycling routes from OpenStreetMap](@/news/2025-08-09/420/index.md) and the first step toward public transport navigation by [displaying bus numbers at bus stops](@/news/2025-09-01/430/index.md). The ongoing work on Android SDK (that complements existing [API][api]), rendering engine, and other core components will allow us to introduce new features in 2026.

This year, we achieved even stronger growth in our install base compared to previous years, finishing the year with a lifetime total of almost 2M downloads on the App Store and almost 3M downloads on Google Play, with European and North American countries topping the list. We estimate at least 1M more Organic Maps Android downloads and installs from other sources, bringing the total to around ***6M downloads across all platforms*** since the app’s launch 5 years ago.
