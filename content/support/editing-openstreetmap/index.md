Do you want to add something that's missing on the map or want to fix an error? Join the community of volunteers that make OpenStreetMap possible. For beginners, it's best to use the [ID Editor](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/issues/203#id-editor). If you don't have a computer with internet at hand, you can also use the basic [Editor of Organic Maps](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/issues/203#editing-with-organic-maps) that works offline.
