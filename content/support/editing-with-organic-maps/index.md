Organic Maps is first and foremost a map app. But it also offers a basic editor that you can use to easily add or fix map data on the fly. It only offers limited functionality and you can only add points of interest from a predefined list or edit properties like opening hours or cousine of existing places. Adding or editing roads or moving places to a new location is not possible. Unlike the ID Editor the built-in editor, however, works offline, once you download the map region. Changes are stored and uploaded to OpenStreetMap.org once you reconnect to the internet.

**!!! In the Play Store Android version logging in with an OSM account is not possible at the moment (see [Issue #7000](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/7000)) (31.01.2024) !!!**

To edit OpenStreetMap directly from your Organic Maps app follow these steps:

1. Create an account at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) if you don't already have one  
2. Log into your account in Organic Maps (burger icon -> *settings* -> *OpenStreetMap-Profile*)  
3. Now you can either edit existing places or add new ones  
   * Edit existing place by tapping on the icon and selecting *edit place*  
     * Add additional information  
     * Save your changes and exit using the check arrow  
   * Add a place to the map  
     * burger icon -> *Add a place to the OpenStreetMap*  
     * Select the location as accurately as you can and press the check arrow  
     * Select a category

        **Can't find a category that fits? Then create an [OSM Note](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/issues/203#osm-notes---i-dont-have-time-for-editing).**

     * Add additional information like the name, opening hours, and website  
     * Save your changes and exit using the check arrow

Editing with Organic Maps is limited. If you can't edit something with the app you can use the [ID Editor](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/issues/203#id-editor) instead, or open an [OSM Note](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/issues/203#osm-notes---i-dont-have-time-for-editing) at OpenStreetMap.org.
