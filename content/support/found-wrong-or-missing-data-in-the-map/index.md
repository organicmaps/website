Did you spot a shop that doesn't exist? Or is your favorite restaurant not on the map? No problem, you can easily fix that! All map data used in Organic Maps comes from OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). And, as OSM is crowd-sourced, anyone, including you, can contribute and fix errors or add missing data.  
It's best to directly fix the problem yourself as described in the [Editing OpenStreetMap](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/issues/203#editing-openstreetmap) section. But if you don't have time for that you can just leave an [OSM Note](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/issues/203#osm-notes---i-dont-have-time-for-editing) for other contributors.
