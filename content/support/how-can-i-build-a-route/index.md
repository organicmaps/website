Organic Maps can build a route for a car trip, bicycle ride, metro or foot walk.

Pick a destination point by tapping on a POI or address or by long tapping on any place. At the place information panel, click on the "Route to" button to start route planning.

By default, OM calculates the route starting from your actual position. You can set the start point of the route by selecting a POI, address or any point on the map and clicking on the “Route From” button in the place information panel.

Push the "Start" button to begin the step-by-step routing.
