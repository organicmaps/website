There are 2 options:

* Option 1: Go to the "Bookmarks and tracks" list and long-press the name of the bookmark that you want to share. In the pop-up menu, select "Share" and choose the method you want to use to share the coordinates (via messengers, SMS, email, etc.).  
    
* Option 2: Select the marker or point on the map, then choose "Share" on the right side (or in the menu).
