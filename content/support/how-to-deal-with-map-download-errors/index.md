If youâ€™re experiencing problems while downloading maps from OM, please try the following:

1. Check that your internet connection is working properly.  
2. Check if you have any firewall apps on the device or on the router.  
3. Try to switch to wifi or cellular connection.  
4. Try another provider/public wifi  
5. Try to use a VPN  
6. On some Android devices, bad SD cards may also lead to download errors. Try to use internal device memory to see if it helps.
