Organic Maps allows you to define certain types of roads to avoid during routing. Go to “Settings → Routing options” menu and select the types of roads that you want to avoid:  
{{ image(src="image45.jpg" classes="max-w-50") }}  
For example, if you want to avoid toll and unpaved roads in your routes, choose the matching options as shown in the previous screenshot.

During route planning, you can click on the button "Define roads to avoid" for quick road avoid setup:   
{{ image(src="image35.jpg" classes="max-w-50") }}  
These routing options are visible only when the route can be modified by them. Otherwise they're hidden.
