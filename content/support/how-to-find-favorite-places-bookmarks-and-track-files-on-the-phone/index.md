Bookmarks and tracks are stored in the private app folder and are not accessible from 3rd party apps.  
On iOS, you can access these files on iPhone/iPad from the desktop using iTunes app.  
On an Android device with Root enabled, you can find the bookmarks in the folder: /data/data/app.organicmaps
