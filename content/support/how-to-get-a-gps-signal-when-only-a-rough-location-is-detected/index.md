If youâ€™re getting a rough (not precise) location in OM, please try the following:

1. Check if fine/precise permissions are given to the app, and are enabled in the system settings.  
2. Go outdoors to get a good GPS signal.  
3. Wait for several minutes to get a precise GPS satellite signal.  
4. Enable internet access for a faster GPS fix.  
5. Make sure that there are no metal/magnet objects close to your device.
