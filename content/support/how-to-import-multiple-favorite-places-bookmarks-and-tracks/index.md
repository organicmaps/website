This functionality is currently only available on Android.

In the “Bookmarks and tracks” list, push on the "Import Bookmarks and tracks" button:

Choose the folder on your device which contains the KML/KMZ/GPX files to import. Organic Maps will scan the picked folder and import all bookmarks and tracks.
