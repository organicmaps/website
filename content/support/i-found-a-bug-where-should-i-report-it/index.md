You can report bugs [here](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues), preferably in English, but you can use Russian as well. Please check if similar bugs have already been reported. If you're not entirely sure it's a bug in the app, it's best to join the developer's chat at [Telegram OrganicMapsRu chat](https://t.me/OrganicMapsRu) or [Telegram OrganicMaps chat](https://t.me/organicmaps) and discuss the issue there. Keep in mind that the presence or absence of a certain incorrect object on the map may not be a bug in the application, but rather an inaccuracy in the OpenStreetMap maps, which you can correct yourself on [OSM.org](https://osm.org). After corrections on OpenStreetMap, the changes will appear in one of the following OM data updates.
