ID is an easy-to-use, beginner-friendly editor for OpenStreetMap data. It runs in your browser, so no installation is required. You, however, need a computer, as the program is not optimized for smartphone screens. If you are new to OSM this is the editor to use.

For editing OpenStreetMap with ID follow these steps:

1. Create or log into your account at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org)  
2. Browse to the location you want to edit on OpenStreetMap.org and click *Edit*  
3. *Start the Walkthrough* and follow the short tutorial that explains the ID Editor  
4. Edit the map  
5. Upload your changes

That's it, you are now part of the OSM community. Wait for the next Organic Maps update to see the changes in your favorite map app.
