If you don't have time or the problem is too complicated for editing the OSM data yourself OSM Notes ([Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes)) are the way to go. You can place such a note in the location of the map error and describe the problem in detail. Other OSM volunteers can then help and solve the issue. You will get e-mail notifications via your OSM account in case they have further questions or the OSM Note is solved.

1. Create or log into your account at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org)  
   You can also open anonymous Notes, but this is not recommended as you won't get notified when the issue is solved or there are further questions.

2. Zoom to the map location on [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and press *Add a note to the map* (second icon from the bottom on the right menu). Then drag the blue map marker to the exact location.  
   Try to be as precise as you can.

3. Provide a detailed description of the map problem and press *Add Note*  
   For shops e.g. provide the name and mention what is sold there or what services are offered
