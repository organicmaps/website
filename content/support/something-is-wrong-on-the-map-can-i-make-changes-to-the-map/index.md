Organic Maps works with map data from the [OpenStreetMap.org](https://osm.org) project. You can improve place details using the "Edit Place" button. To make your changes publicly available, you need an account on [OpenStreetMap.org](https://osm.org). Please update to the latest map version first, prior to making changes to the map.

If you want to change a POI position, modify a footway, or add buildings and bridges, please use the powerful editing tools available at the [OpenStreetMap.org](https://osm.org) site.
