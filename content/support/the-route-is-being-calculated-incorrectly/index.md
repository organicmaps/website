First, check if the data in OpenStreetMap where the route is not correctly calculated is correct.  
If you detect a data error (for example: not connected ways, incorrect one way street directions, missing turn restrictions, etc.), please make the correction using any of the available [OpenStreetMap editing tools](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editors). Hopefully, in the next OM map update this routing problem should be solved!!  
If you verify that itâ€™s not an OSM data error, please [report the problem](@/support/i-found-a-bug-where-should-i-report-it/index.md); we will check it and work on improving the routing algorithms.
