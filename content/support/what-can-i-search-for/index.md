In the search input field, you can enter anything. Not only what's in the categories, but also any other type on the map displayed in the Place Page.  
You can search places, addresses, cities, sites and many other interests. Organic Maps not only looks by name, but also by type. You can find the nearest drinking water, bicycle parking, bookstore or cave from the search field.  
You can also [search GPS coordinates](@/support/search-gps-coordinates/index.md) in different formats.
