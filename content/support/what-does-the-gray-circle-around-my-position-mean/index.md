GPS sensors have a certain location accuracy and this gray circle indicates visually this accuracy. Your actual position is somewhere inside this circle. The better the accuracy, the smaller the gray circle. Accuracy degrades inside buildings, near steel constructions or radiation sources. To improve GPS precision, go outside to be under clear sky and try to stay away from buildings, bridges, etc.  
Enabling [Google Location Accuracy](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/2839911?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) on Android improves the precision significantly.
