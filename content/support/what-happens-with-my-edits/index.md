Once you press Upload your changes are instantly added to the public OSM database. So be considerate when editing. Your email is not published, but other people will be able to see your OSM user name.  
As OSM offers the possibility to discuss changes, you might get questions about your edits from other OSM contributors. You will be notified about this via the e-mail address you used for registering your OSM account. As OSM is a community project that builds on collaboration you should always answer such questions.
