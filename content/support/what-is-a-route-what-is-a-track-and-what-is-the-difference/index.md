A route is a way or course defined from a starting and a destination point and (optionally) a set of intermediate stop points. A route contains a set of turn indications that enables the navigation of the course using a particular means of transport (vehicle, bicycle, foot or metro).

On the other hand, a track is a trajectory defined by a list of fixed geographical points that has normally been recorded from a GPS device.

The main difference between routes and tracks is that routes are calculated dynamically by the OM routing engine based on data of OSM maps, while the tracks are a list of fixed geo points. Routes can be used for navigation purposes, while tracks are just a visual display on the map.
