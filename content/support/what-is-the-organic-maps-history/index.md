Organic Maps was created by the founders of Maps.me. In 2011 MapsWithMe (later renamed to [Maps.me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps.me)) was founded and in September 2015 a decision was made to open-source the app. In 2021, the free and open-source software ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) community collaborated to create a privacy focused maps navigation app using Maps.me open-source code as a starting point, to create a faster and simplified navigation app, and Organic Maps was born. A publicly released app became available in the app stores in August 2021.
