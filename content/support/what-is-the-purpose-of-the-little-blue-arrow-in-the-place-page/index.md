This arrow shows direction and straight-line distance from your location to the selected POI (Point Of Interest). Your location shall be enabled in order to see this blue arrow.

Pressing this button shows a fullscreen indicator with the orientation and distance to the POI. You can use it for azimuth navigation if step-by-step routing is not possible for some reason.
