Since the project is non-commercial, the addition of new features happens when developers have the time to program them alongside their main jobs. Therefore, we cannot provide forecasts for the timing of the implementation of specific features. If you are a professional developer, we welcome your help in implementing new features or fixing bugs, of which there are plenty [here](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues).
