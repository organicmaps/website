The data is stored in the private folder of the application: /sdcard/Android/data/app.organicmaps (Android 10 and lower), /storage/XXXX-YYYY/Android/data/app.organicmaps (Android 11 and higher), or /data/data/app.organicmaps.  
Google has restricted access to these files for all applications. You cannot access these files without root access or a file manager with the necessary permissions at the operating system level. This requirement was introduced by Google starting from Android 11 and later. If it weren't for the threat of discontinuing updates on Google Play, we would have kept the maps and markers where they used to be.
