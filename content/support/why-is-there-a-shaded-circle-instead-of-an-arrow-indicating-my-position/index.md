You are located somewhere inside the circle as the GPS signal is not fully detecting your location. The GPS signal does not work well inside concrete buildings, near metal objects, or large antennas. Tablets don't have a compass sensor and a circle is drawn instead of a directed arrow. You can find your model on [gsmarena.com](https://www.gsmarena.com) to see if a compass is present.
